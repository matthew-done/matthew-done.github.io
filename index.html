                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Matthew. In 2025 I completed a four-year Bachelor's degree in Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin and in 2026 I will be moving on to continue studying theoretical physics at graduate level in a new location!
                    I made this website to serve as an accumulated portfolio of learning material and completed projects of mine which I want to share with anyone who may find them useful.   <p>

                    For a full explanation of my past research please see my <a href="research.html">research</a> page.
                    Or click on the image to see an example of my work. During my undergraduate studies I came into contact with 
                    many interesting areas of theoretical and mathematical physics, and my research has taken place mostly in
                    the areas of analytical high-energy physics, quantum field theory, gauge theory and supersymmetry.
