                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Thomas, I'm doing a masters in theoretical physics at St John's College Cambridge.
                    I am a big fan of open-source philosophy, so I mainly made this site to host my
                          course  <a href="notes.html">notes</a> so feel free to check them out. 
                          You can also check out my github page <a href="https://github.com/Tbrosnan12">here</a>.  
                         I am an aspiring Theoretical Cosmologist and applying to a PhD next year somewhere...   <p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    For a full explanation of my past research please see my <a href="research.html">research</a> page.
                     Or click on the image to see an example of my work. 
                    Over the last few years I have learned a lot of physics, but my research interests have all come to be 
                    related to cosmology, primarily Dark Energy but also other topics including modifications of GR, 
                    inflation and quantum gravity in general.
                </p>

                <p>

                I am interested in Cosmology as I believe it is the best testing ground for fundamental physics. The field 
                is also entering a new age, akin I feel to the 'particle zoo era' of the late 1940's/50's. 
                We have many ongoing and future planned cosmology experiments that are tearing cracks in our best cosmological 
                models. This is a very exciting period and I am very interested to see how our work to make sense of these problems
                will give us new insights into fundamental physics.
                </p>
                 <p>
                The ultimate goal of studying cosmology in my view, is to use it to probe Quantum Gravity, which over the last 50 years
                has solidified itself as the largest hole in our knowledge of physics. Our attempts so far have not been successful
                and there is no clear way forward. I am interested in approaches to quantum gravity that have phenomenological 
                implications particularly in Cosmology. Most of my experience is with <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_sets">Causal Set Theory</a>,
                which is a discrete approach to quantum gravity that posits space time to be made of 'atoms'. Causal Set Theory
                has a very natural explanation of Dark Energy as I outlined in my <a href="https://tbrosnan12.github.io#seminar">part III seminar on the subject</a>.

                <h2>Linux</h2> 
                <p>
                I am a big fan of Linux, particularly the <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> distribution. I maintain 
                a Raspberry pi 5 server (see my cardboard box set up to the right) and like to data hoard. I believe the Linux 
                communities approach to open source software and ideas is highly effective and is something that should be 
                sought after. I encourage anyone I can to try open source alternatives such as Linux, they offer so much upside
                and make technology enjoyable to use, something that is becoming increasingly rare in today's world.

          <h2>Part III Seminar </h2>
                  <p> 
                  Recently as part of my partaking of part III of the 
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos">Mathematical Tripos</a>
                  I had the pleasure of giving a seminar to my fellow students. I chose to give this seminar on 
                  "Dynamical Dark Energy from Causal Set Theory" as it is an area I am deeply interested and one that
                  is under-appreciated/not-known by many people. The causal set model of dark energy known as "Everpresent 
                  lambda" has become even more interesting with the recent news that the Cosmological constant 
                  is indicated to be dynamical, something that is inherently part of this model. In my talk I gave a break 
                  down of the problems with the cosmological constant and how causal set theory can ease these tensions.

          <h2>Theoretical Physics Student Association</h2>
                  <p> 
                    The <a href="https://tpsa.ie">TPSA</a>  is a student led organisation based in Trinity College Dublin.
                    The TPSA runs weekley seminars where students enter a collaborative space to discuss 
                    homework problems or ask physics questions of the older years. The association also hosts hackathons, faculty talks 
                    as well as workshops to help fellow students. Previously I was the associations treasurer as well as the PLANCKS
                    Captain. I have produced a 6 part lecture series on general relativity (see my <a href="lectures.html">lectures</a> page!)
                    which is on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tpsa_ireland">TPSA youtube channel</a> , I also conducted an 
                    ”Introduction to LaTeX” talk, to introduce the younger students to the typesetting language.

                     As part of the TPSA I also had the great pleasure of being captain of the highly successful 2023/24 PLANCKS
                    team. <a href="https://plancks.uk">PLANCKS</a> is a exam-based physics competition for bachelor’s and master’s students. I captained the team
                    representing Trinity at the UK & Ireland preliminary in Surrey, where we qualified to represent Ireland at the final
                    held in Dublin, Ireland.
