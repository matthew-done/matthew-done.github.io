                  <h2>QFT on Causal Sets - 2025</h2>
                  <p> 
                 In the summer of 2025 I undertook a research project under the supervision of Dr Yasaman Yazdi  at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies <a href="https://www.dias.ie/stp">(DIAS)</a>.  This was my first introduction to causal set theory. Alongside Dr Yazdi I investigated quantum field theory on causal sets, particularly in (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. This involved simulating causal sets and comparing functions of different elements, such as propagators, to their known continuum curves. </p> 

              <p>     This is part of the overall goal of showing QFT on causal sets produces the same results as the continuum limit, including in curved spacetime. We are in the process of writing a paper on the results.

                <h2>Quantum Aspects of Schwarzschild de Sitter Black Holes- 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    My Final Year Project investigated many aspects of  
                    Quantum Field Theory (QFT) in curved spacetimes. This is the study of quantum fields 
                    propagating in a classical gravitational field. 
                </p>
                <p>        
                    My research began with a detailed study 
                    of the Unruh Effect and Hawking radiation. The primary goal of this project was to take 
                    these ideas learned from the Unruh Affect and Hawking Radiation and use them to analyse 
                    Raphael Bousso and Stephen Hawking's paper titled "(Anti-)Evaporation of Schwarzschild
                    -de Sitter Black Holes". Here a Schwarzschild black hole is immersed in de Sitter spacetime
                     and it is shown that different quantum fluctuations of the metric lead to some
                     stable and some evaporating modes.

                    <h2>Testing Single-Pulse-Search Algorithms   - 2024</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2024, as an intern with Breakthrough Listen Search for Extra-terrestrial Life (SETI), 
                        I focused my research on the analysis of single pulse detection algorithms; which are 
                        useful in the detection of Fast Radio bursts and exotic pulsar systems. I analysed several 
                        different algorithms and built a pipeline that created synthetic pulses and benchmarked 
                        them against each other over a wide parameter space to see where each was best. My results 
                        showed that a popular algorithm is not sensitive to wide-width pulses, meaning some 
                        detections could have been missed in several surveys. Find the <a href="https://github.com/Tbrosnan12/Single_pulse_test">on my Github page</a>.

          <h2>Testing Theories of Gravity with Pulsars    - 2023 </h2>
                  <p> 
                    In the summer of 2023 I took part in the Hamilton Trust Internship at the School of Mathematics TCD. 
                    Working with Professor Evan Keane, I used pulsars as a medium to test theories of gravity such as
                    General Relativity (GR) and Yukawa like gravity, deriving equations in both theories that governed how 
                    the parameters of a binary system containing a pulsar changed with time due to the various effects
                    of the given theory.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The parameters that were calculated are known as Post Keplerian (PK) parameters and their calculation 
                    in different theories of gravity is important as they can be used to directly test these theories. 
                    The parameters are functions of the two masses of the binary system so when plotted (see figure to 
                    the left) given observational values of the PK parameters they create curves in the space of the two 
                    masses. This provides excellent test of the theories as these curves must cross at a single point, 
                    at the actual values of the two masses of the system. 
                  </p>

                <p>
                    What I showed was that if you calculate these parameters in Yukawa like gravity they lead to the same 
                    first order PK parameters as GR plus some small corrections. But, I also noticed that since the observational 
                    constraints on the scale of gravity are quite strong, the order of magnitude at which these extra 
                    corrections come in is the same order as that of the second order approximation of the GR parameters.
                    I also calculated these second order parameters and showed that they take a similar form, hence testing
                    Yukawa gravity in this way is difficult.     
                  </p>
