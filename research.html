          <h2> Soliton Solutions in Self-Dual Yang-Mills Theory - 2025 </h2>
                  <p> 
                    In the summer of 2025 I took part in the Hamilton Trust Internship at the School of Mathematics, Trinity College Dublin. 
                    Working with Professor Tristan McLoughlin, I studied the soliton solutions of the SDYM equations from the perspective of integrable models.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In lower-dimensional integrable models which admit soliton solutions, such as the KdV and KP equations, the existence and physical interpretation of multi-soliton solutions are well understood.
                    In particular, multi-soliton solutions in the simpler models are expressed in terms of Wronskian-type determinants but in non-Abelian gauge theory the non-commutative quasideterminant formalism is required.
                    The goal of this project was to study how multi-solitons can be constructed from seed solutions of the SDYM equations and whether soliton dynamics could be understood for certain choices of the gauge group.
                    Yang-Mills theory stands as a key element in the study of fundamental particles and understanding soliton solutions could provide a groundbreaking avenue in analytical high-energy physics in the future.

                <h2>Parisi-Sourlas Quantisation of Constrained Hamiltonian Systems - 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    My final year project in Trinity College Dublin where I researched an alternative method for quantising field theories
                    with first and second class constraints in the canoncial formalism. The project involved aspects from classical and 
                    quantum field theory, gauge theory, supersymmetry and symplectic geometry.
                </p>
                <p>        
                    My research began with a detailed study of classical contrained systems in the canonical formalism based on the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm.
                    This was followed by a review of the BRST formalism which was originally discovered by researchers who were attempting to quantise gauge theories,
                    particularly pure Yang-Mills theory. The goal of my project was to introduce the Parisi-Sourlas formalism and show how it generalises the BRST formalism
                    to a method which can be applied to quantise systems with both first and second class constraints - the BRST formalism can only be applied to first class constraints, 
                    or a system of second class constraints which have been converted to effective first class constraints using, for example, the BFT embedding method. 
                    Using the non-Abelian pure Yang-Mills theory as a toy model I was able to show that the Parisi-Sourlas construction successfully leads to a covariant path-integral formulated
                    over an extended phase space which is formally equivalent to the path-integral of the original system by virtue of the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry. Additionally, the known BRST 
                    charge of pure Yang-Mills theory was recovered as the localised expression of a specific generator of Parisi-Sourlas transformations.
